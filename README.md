# rustray

A rudimentary system tray implemented in Rust.

This is more of an experiment than something you should use on a daily basis. I
primarily wrote it to understand how the system tray mechanics work in X. This
doesn't actually implement all of the system tray specification but it works for
most of the programs I use.
